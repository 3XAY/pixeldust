Welcome to Pixeldust, the latest YSWS @ Hack Club project that empowers you to design your very own custom PCBs and take your hardware ideas from concept to reality! Whether you're a seasoned PCB designer or just getting started with electronics, Pixeldust offers an easy, interactive way to bring your ideas to life.

What is Pixeldust?
Pixeldust is a platform that allows you to create your own PCB design using KiCad, write your firmware with Wokwi, and then receive your custom PCBs delivered straight to your door! Itâ€™s a hands-on learning experience that combines the power of open-source tools with the thrill of creating something tangible.

Coming Soon: What to Expect
Weâ€™re currently in development, but thereâ€™s a lot more on the way to help you with your PCB design journey. Hereâ€™s a sneak peek at what weâ€™ll be launching soon:

PCB Design Guides: Step-by-step guides on how to use KiCad to create your own PCB designs. Whether youâ€™re a beginner or looking to refine your skills, these guides will help you build and optimize your designs.

Submission Rules: Clear and concise submission guidelines for submitting your PCBs to the platform for production. Make sure your designs meet our specifications before sending them off to be made!

Parts Allowed: A comprehensive list of components and parts you can use in your designs. This will ensure compatibility and help streamline your workflow.

Examples: Real-world examples of PCBs created using Pixeldust, showcasing whatâ€™s possible. Get inspired and learn from others as you build your own creations.

How It Works
Design Your PCB: Use KiCad to create your PCB layout. Donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re new to KiCad! Weâ€™ll provide guides soon to help you get started.

Write Your Firmware: Once your PCB is ready, you can start writing the firmware in Wokwi. This is where your PCB comes to life! With Wokwiâ€™s easy-to-use platform, you can simulate and test your design before itâ€™s real.

Submit for Production: After finalizing your design and firmware, submit your PCB to Pixeldust for manufacturing. Weâ€™ll send your PCBs straight to youâ€”ready for assembly!

Assemble and Test: Once your PCB arrives, it's time to assemble the components and see your creation come to life. Youâ€™ll have the satisfaction of holding your own design in your hands!
